# Pendulum Reinforcement Learning with Ray RLlib - HPCAI M2 MOSIG 2025/2026 Project
This project implements a reinforcement learning solution for the **Pendulum-v1** environment using **Ray RLlib** with the **PPO** algorithm. It's designed to run on Grid5000 for comparing single-node vs multi-node performance.
